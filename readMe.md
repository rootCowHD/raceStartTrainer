<h1>Race Start Trainer</h1>
<h2>Idea</h2>
The Idea behind this Timer is simpel, getting used to a "with in" race start timer. 
This time can be different from Race to Race, so the Start in the Script must be variable, too.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
For now (V0.7) the Script is static and in active development:
- Telemetry Screen is optimized for the Taranis xLite (openTX 2.2.2) but should also work with any other FrSky Radio<br>
- Control works via Betaflight Telemetry only<br>
- Control works via FrSky (SmarPort / F.Port) only<br>
- Voices need to be set up for number Readings

<h2>How to use it</h2>
- Download RS_COW.lua and put it on your Radio under: SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY<br>
- Copy the RACESTART Structure in your SCRIPTS Folder (This Structure will be used in later Versions)<br>

<h2>What's to do before V1</h2>
- Make an "start by switch" option (to get rid of forced Telemetry), V0.8<br>
- Optimize the Screen for other Radios, V0.9<br>
- Split into multiple Files for a better overview and less Memory use V1.0<br>
- Implement FallBack Audio Files<br>
- Optimize Visuals<br>
